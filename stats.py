    # 2. THE CORE REGEX PATTERN: Find sequences of word characters.
    #    \b: Word boundary - ensures we get whole words.
    #    [\w']+ : Matches one or more "word characters" (\w includes a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and underscore '_')
    #              AND also explicitly includes the apostrophe (').
    #    This pattern will capture:
    #    - "hello"
    #    - "world123"
    #    - "don't" (as one word)
    #    - "it's" (as one word)
    #    - "cat's" (as one word)
    #    - "123"
    #    - "underscore_word" (as one word)

    #    What about hyphens? If the gold standard counts "self-evident" 
    #    as ONE word, then the simple [\w']+ won't do it, as the hyphen isn't 
    #    a \w. 
    #    To include hyphens within words (e.g., "self-evident" as one word):
    #    We'll use a more specific pattern: letters/numbers, and optional 
    #    hyphens or apostrophed, followed by more letters/numbers.
    
    #!!! BETTER REAL-LIFE VERSION:
    # words = re.findall(r"[a-z0-9]+(?:['\-][a-z0-9]+)*", normalized_contents)
    
    # Breakdown of this new findall pattern:
    # [a-z0-9]+ : Matches one or more lowercase letters or digits. This forms the base of a word.
    # (?:      )*: This is a non-capturing group that can appear zero or more times.
    #   ['\-]  : Matches either a literal apostrophe (') OR a literal hyphen (-).
    #   [a-z0-9]+: Matches one or more lowercase letters or digits immediately following the apostrophe or hyphen.
    # This pattern is robust because:
    # - It will capture "hello", "123", "word-word", "don't", "cat's".
    # - It effectively treats hyphens and apostrophes as *internal* parts of words if they are surrounded by alphanumeric characters.
    # - It will naturally split on spaces, newlines, and any other punctuation not explicitly included.

    # 3. Filter out any empty strings or purely non-alphanumeric remnants.
    #    re.findall generally does a good job, but this is a final cleanup.
    
    # actual_words = [word for word in words if word] # Simplest way to filter out empty strings
    
    # return len(actual_words)
